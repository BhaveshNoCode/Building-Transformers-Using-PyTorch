This project focuses on the development of an automated news topic classification system leveraging machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset sourced from AG, comprising over 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples across four major classes, the aim is to classify news articles into predefined topics. The project entails thorough data preprocessing, including cleaning and formatting, followed by the implementation of three transformer architectures selected for their efficacy in handling sequential data and contextual information. Training and evaluation involve rigorous assessment over ten epochs, with optimization techniques such as early stopping, regularization, dropout, and learning rate tuning employed to enhance model performance and mitigate overfitting. Evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, provide insights into model effectiveness and robustness. Overall, the project seeks to develop a system capable of accurately categorizing news articles, contributing to improved information retrieval and analysis across various domains.
